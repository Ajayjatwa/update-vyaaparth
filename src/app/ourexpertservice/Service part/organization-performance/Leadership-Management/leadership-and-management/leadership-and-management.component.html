With Organizational Risk and Readiness Assessment (ORRA), we can accurately identify an organization's strengths and opportunities, allowing leaders to benchmark their results against decades of survey responses. As we work together to develop or reinforce a strategy to sustain results, after completing the assessment, we identify necessary changes, manage resistance to change, build communication plans, and build communication plans to manage change.
