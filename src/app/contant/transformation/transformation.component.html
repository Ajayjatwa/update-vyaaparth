          <h2>Do Service Operations need to be transformed?</h2><br>
          <p>According to a study of responses from the most successful service organizations based on results achieved, 71% of this group had a better grasp of the definition of digital transformation services.</p>
          <p>Customers' attitude plays a vital role in brand image and referral sales in this age of digital media and social media. Therefore, highly successful organizations take services very seriously to ensure their customers are satisfied throughout the relationship. This results in customers returning to the company again and again, as well as recommending or endorsing its products and services.</p>

                     <h3>Develop a fully integrated logistical and delivery value chain</h3>
                     <p>Digital acceleration requires a minimum number of control points in processes necessary for a highly automated world. Suppose your business requires third-party providers, spare parts, and logistics. In that case, you must integrate your operations with those departments as highly as possible so that service operations play little or no role in service delivery. Furthermore, integrating marketing and sales automatically keeps everyone updated on the overall customer status, improving customer engagements.</p>

              <p>The past has seen companies pay more attention to sales transactions while seeing services as an 'after-sales support' function or as a 'necessary headache.' Now, the pendulum has swung in the other direction.</p>
              <p>The number of touchpoints a company has with its customers is a critical factor in determining its success in the digital economy. Customers of the most successful companies are contacted at least 10 times a year. Consistent, undisrupted, and the ability to 'serve without being asked' have become the watchwords for digitalized enterprises. Process digitalization is expected to take place in Sales & Marketing and partners, suppliers, and logistics.</p>
              <p>High-performing Services organization that focuses on providing customers with the services they expect quietly, retaining their business, and reaping new sales.</p>
              <p>Vyaaparth's Services department partners with clients on these key transformation themes</p>

              <h3>Ensure a data-driven, predictive culture</h3>
              <p>Cost-cutting services are sometimes necessary to achieve profitability or improve on-time delivery. Through comprehensive service analytics across each aspect of the value chain, such as customers, delivery partners, parts suppliers, and third-party logistics providers, you will begin to understand the root causes of all issues across the board and drive incremental improvements.</p>
              <p>Using predictive analytics will also assist in a 'what-if' analysis. It will set the priority and agenda for iterative transformations that will deliver results in the near term while improving the overall operations.</p>
