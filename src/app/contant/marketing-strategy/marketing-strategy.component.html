                  <p class="card-text">Marketing was one of the original pioneers of digital transformation, beginning in the early 2000s with the first modern websites, then with apps, delivering better experiences, and delivering digital marketing to customers.
                    These days, all these aspects of a company are considered standard, and an excellent website or email marketing campaign no longer separates them from their competitors. An international survey of 550+ Marketing leaders asked them, "What does digital transformation mean to your organization?".'</p>
                    <p>Over 55% of respondents said that digital transformation in marketing means better websites and portals, which indicates that most companies aren't taking it seriously enough. About 45% of respondents are currently using omnichannel marketing or are implementing brand new digital paradigms.</p>

                    More than 30% of companies will not survive in this decade, regardless of their industry, location, size, or brand, and COVID will only accelerate that trend. Customers consider their product or service to be less valuable and less useful as time goes on.
                    Marketing is, therefore, the voice of the customer- resonating with their needs to help reinvent products and then articulating the value of the new products and services. Your products and services will be irrelevant if customers cannot perceive and accept their relevance.</p>
